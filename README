Import CSV Data into Cassandra:

Utility can be used to import large CSV data into  Cassandra Column family.   It is used to import large CSV files (probably exported from SQL DBs like MySQL , PostGre SQL) into Cassandra. If required consistency level can also be maintained  while carrying out imports.  I had to import 10GB+ CSV files into cassandra, but only if  nodes in each zone were up  so consistency level was used. 

Utilitiy is built using https://github.com/rantav/hector API to import data into Cassandra.

Steps:
1. Configure following parameters at config/config.xml (Sample Config File is already present):
	1. hostName 
	2. port
	3. clusterName
	4. consistencyLevel
	5. columnFamily
	6. keySpace
	7. importFile
	8. delimeter
2. After configuration just run the utility, and  keeping checking logs if you think it is  taking  long time.


Assumptions: 

   First row of CSV is header row i.e column names for our column family
and similarly first column is key. 

Wish List: 

   1. Mapping of multiple CSV into Single Column Family and vice versa.
   2. Configurable column for keys.
