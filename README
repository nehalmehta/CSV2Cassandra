CSV2Cassandra is utility to convert existing CSV data into Cassandra. 
I had 10GB+ CSV files, which I wanted to import into cassandra, but using 
consistency level of EACH_QORUM. So I have written this utility which 
parses CSV data and imports it into Cassandra. I have used Hector API 
(https://github.com/rantav/hector) to import data into cassandra. 

Configuration Parameters such as host name, port, column family etc 
are specificed at config/config.xml

Assumptions: 

    First row of CSV is header row i.e column names for our column family
and similarly first column is key. 

Wish List: 

    1. Mapping of multiple CSV into Single Column Family and vice versa.
    2. Configurable column for keys.
